# JUnit Exploration

Welcome to the **JUnit Features Exploration** repository! This repository is designed to help you learn and experiment with the key features of the JUnit testing framework for Java applications.

## Overview
JUnit is a widely used testing framework for Java that makes it easy to write and run unit tests. This repository demonstrates the following features of JUnit:

- Assertions
- Parameterized Tests
- Test Lifecycle Methods
- Exception Testing
- Integration with Mockito for Mocking
- Test Suites
- Timeouts
- Tagging and Filtering Tests

Each feature is demonstrated in dedicated test files under the `src/test/java` directory.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or later
- A build tool (Gradle or Maven)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rvguradiya/junit-exploration.git
   cd JUnit-Features-Demo
   ```

2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

3. Build the project using Gradle or Maven:
   ```bash
   # Gradle
   ./gradlew build
